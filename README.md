## Step 8: Logging, Formatting, and Error Handling

- The script was executed in **Windows Git Bash**.  
- Since the commands `top` and `free` are not available in Git Bash, the error handling part of the script was triggered.  
- The script successfully wrote these events into **health.log**, proving that logging works.  
- In a real Linux VM (e.g., Ubuntu or CentOS), the commands would work correctly and show actual CPU and memory usage.
